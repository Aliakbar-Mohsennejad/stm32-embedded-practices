#  STM32 Microcontroller Coursework Repository

##  Overview
This repository contains a complete collection of academic assignments for the **Microprocessor Systems** course, designed around practical applications of **STM32 microcontrollers**. Each project explores hardware control, RTC time management, low-power modes, and clock configuration using the STM32 HAL library.

##  Assignments Overview

###  Clock Management in STM32
This assignment covers the internal and external clock management systems in STM32 microcontrollers, including:
- HSI, HSE, LSI, LSE, and PLL clock sources
- The use of the Clock Security System (CSS)
- Configuration of AHB and APB bus systems

**Goal:** Understand how clock sources affect timing, power, and performance in embedded systems.

###  Smart Irrigation System
An **RTC-based automated irrigation controller** that activates a water valve twice daily (at 9:00 AM and 9:00 PM) for exactly 10 minutes.  
- Relay controlled through **PA0**
- EXTI button toggles enable/disable state
- RTC keeps precise timing
- Designed for minimal power consumption

**Features:**
- RTC alarms for scheduling
- Debounced EXTI interrupt for user control
- Safe shutdown and enable logic

---

###  Secure Relay Lock System
A **time-window‚Äìrestricted access controller** for a relay-based lock.  
The lock accepts access requests only between **07:45‚Äì12:00** and **13:00‚Äì17:30**.

**Key Functionalities:**
- 8-second timed unlock via RTC Alarm A
- Pressing the button again restarts the timer
- Supervisor button disables the system
- RTC validation check at startup
- Dual LEDs (green and red) indicate system state

**Fail-Safe Design:**
- Relay always OFF at startup or mode transitions  
- Button bounce filtered using software debounce

---

###  Three-Level Lighting System
Implements a **multi-level lighting controller** with both **manual** and **AUTO** modes.

**Outputs:** `PA0`, `PA1`, `PA2`  
**Mode Logic:**
- High: All ON (06:00‚Äì17:00)  
- Medium: Two ON (17:00‚Äì23:00)  
- Low: One ON (23:00‚Äì06:00)  
- Off: All OFF  
- AUTO: Automatically adjusts based on RTC time

**Additional Features:**
- Mode selection via button on `PC13` (EXTI13)
- Green LED indicates AUTO mode
- Red LED blinks when RTC invalid (300ms ON / 700ms OFF)
- Immediate correction when RTC time changes

---

###  Power Modes and Clock Sources
An analytical and practical comparison between **STM32F1** and **STM32L4** families in terms of:
- Power modes: Run, Sleep, Stop, and Standby
- Clock sources: HSE, HSI, MSI, LSE, LSI, PLL
- Energy optimization techniques

**Power Optimization Techniques:**
- Use of LSE for accurate RTC timekeeping
- Peripheral clock gating via RCC
- GPIO configuration to prevent floating inputs
- DMA and peripheral autonomy (Timer ‚Üí ADC ‚Üí DMA ‚Üí RAM)

**Outcome:** Achieve maximum energy efficiency and system reliability for embedded and IoT applications.

---

##  Technical Information
- **Language:** C (HAL Library)
- **IDE:** STM32CubeIDE / STM32CubeMX
- **Microcontroller:** STM32F103C8T6 or STM32L4 series
- **Peripherals Used:** GPIO, RCC, RTC, EXTI, DMA, NVIC
